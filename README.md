### 1. **Gender Distribution**
- **Overall**: The workforce consists of **59% male** and **41% female** employees, but this varies significantly by job level and department.
- **New Hires and Promotions**: FY20 new hires were balanced (**34 males**, **32 females**), but promotion rates show disparity—males were promoted more frequently in both FY20 (**9.5% vs. 3.9%**) and FY21 (**11.2% vs. 8.8%**).

### 2. **Job Level Distribution**
- **Disproportionate Representation**: Males dominate higher levels (e.g., **6.4% male** at the executive level), with a narrowing gender gap at **Manager**, **Senior Officer**, and **Junior Officer** levels, but female representation drops significantly at higher levels.

### 3. **Performance Ratings**
- **Minimal Gender Difference**: Males slightly outperform females by **0.01 to 0.02** points, suggesting performance is not a key barrier to promotion for women.

### 4. **Turnover and Retention**
- **Turnover Rate**: Overall turnover is **9.4%**, with higher female turnover (**10.2%** vs. **8.8%**). Female turnover is highest at the **Junior Officer** level, which may reduce the pool of potential female leaders.

### 5. **Departmental Disparities**
- **Uneven Gender Distribution**: Departments like **Finance** and **HR** have more males in senior roles, while **Internal Services** and **Operations** are more balanced but still show male dominance at senior levels. **Strategy** is particularly male-dominated at senior levels.

### Root Causes of Slow Gender Progress at Executive Levels
1. **Promotion Bias**: Promotions favor men, especially at higher levels.
2. **Retention Issues**: Higher female turnover, particularly at junior levels, reduces the talent pool.
3. **Work-Life Balance**: Lack of supportive policies for women balancing caregiving responsibilities.
4. **Sponsorship Gap**: Women may lack mentorship and sponsorship needed for career advancement.
5. **Organizational Culture**: Cultural biases in certain departments hinder gender balance progress at senior levels.

### Recommendations for Addressing the Issue

1. **Review Promotion Practices**: Identify and eliminate biases in promotion criteria, implementing structured and transparent processes to ensure equity.
2. **Enhanced Retention Programs**: Create targeted retention programs for women at junior levels, including mentorship, leadership training, and flexible work arrangements.
3. **Work-Life Balance Initiatives**: Implement or improve gender-neutral policies like flexible hours, remote work, and parental leave to retain female talent.
4. **Sponsorship and Mentorship**: Launch formal programs where senior leaders sponsor and mentor high-potential female employees.
5. **Cultural Change**: Promote diversity and inclusion through leadership accountability, diversity training, and setting clear targets.
